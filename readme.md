# Clint's Blog

This blog is setup specifically so only I have authorization to view/edit/delete entries. For someone else to use this blog template, they must use a seed file to create the initial user or simply remove middleware checking if the user is admin for signing up a user. Only admin level accounts can create non-admin accounts that can view posts, but nothing more.

## TODO

* "Are you sure?" for delete button--I don't want to accidentally remove an entire post.
* Create a sidebar in posts/show that links to other posts from that same month.
* Create next/previous buttons at the bottom of posts/show that go forward/back in time.
